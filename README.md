# ANN-Based-Cancer-Detection
Workflow - 
 - Importing and visualising the dataset which consists of a large number of parameters which are used to train the model and predicting the results of diagnosis column hence predicting whether a person has a cancer or not.
 - Cleaning the data by simplifying it and dropping the unnecessary part of it.
 - Finding correlation using heatmaps between several tests/measures or parameters we used to detect the cancer.
 - Proportionating training and testing dataset & assigning the independent and dependent variable.
 - Applying ANN model and optimizing the parameters to get best results
 
 Note - While importing dataset please download the given dataset and enter its location to read the .csv file
#### Accuracy of my model varies from 95-97 %
